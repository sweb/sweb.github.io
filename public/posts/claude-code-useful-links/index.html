This is my collection of useful blog posts on how to use Claude Code:

ClaudeLog: Extensive collection of information about Claude Code, how to set it up and what workflows have worked. Also some motivation why using tools like Claude Code is basically a must have.
Field Notes from Shipping Real Code with Claude: Lot&rsquo;s of helpful notes on how a team is using Claude Code, especially what to include in CLAUDE.md.
Agentic Coding Recommendations: Post about techniques to make Claude Code viable and what works, e.g. the choice for using Go as a language and the idea that iteration speed is the most important thing.
My First Open Source AI Generated Library: Short but specific post by Armin Ronacher about building a Python library using Claude Code
Here’s how I use LLMs to help me write code: Long post by Simon Willison with general advice on using LLMs for coding that also features a Claude Code example.
