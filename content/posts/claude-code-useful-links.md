In the last weeks I have been using [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) more and more. Before that, aider was my main driver with occasional use of Github Copilot now and then.

This is my collection of useful blog posts on how to use Claude Code:

* [ClaudeLog](https://claudelog.com/): Extensive collection of information about Claude Code, how to set it up and what workflows have worked. Also some motivation why using tools like Claude Code is basically a must have.
* [Field Notes from Shipping Real Code with Claude](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dxiConBZTd33sFaRC/field-notes-from-shipping-real-code-with-claude): Lot's of helpful notes on how a team is using Claude Code, especially what to include in `CLAUDE.md`.
* [Agentic Coding Recommendations](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/6/12/agentic-coding/): Post about techniques to make Claude Code viable and what works, e.g. the choice for using Go as a language and the idea that iteration speed is the most important thing.
* [My First Open Source AI Generated Library](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/6/21/my-first-ai-library/): Short but specific post by Armin Ronacher about building a Python library using Claude Code
* [Hereâ€™s how I use LLMs to help me write code](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/): Long post by Simon Willison with general advice on using LLMs for coding that also features a Claude Code example.
