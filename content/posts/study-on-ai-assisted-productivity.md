title = 'Study on AI Assisted Productivity'
+++

This is primarily a bookmark about a [study](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/), conducted at the start of 2025 about productivity impact of using Cursor. Key finding:

The productivity actually decreases, even though expected and perceived productivity gain of the participants is around 20%


There are a couple of ideas why this result may not be skewed but first it is important to acknowledge that this is a proper study setup and the results clearly point out that using AI assisted tooling does not increase productivity. Thus, we should be mindful to the fact that productivity gains for developers are not as easy to achieve as oftentimes advertised.

The best explanation that I have heard so far for why the results are what they are comes from [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/12/ai-open-source-productivity/) that this is a mixture of a steep learning curve using these tools and that the study participants were deeply familiar with the repositories they applied Cursor to.
